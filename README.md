# Metakiller



This is a tool that I was looking forward to building, as it will be useful in order to make images uploaded to the web, less cluttered with metadata and pretty much well optimized for web and/or mobile applications. And by all means it was also conceived as an excuse for me to practice and learn a bit of python which has gotten so popular lately.


It basically strips images metadata and decreases images size by reducing their quality to a reasonable percentage.
